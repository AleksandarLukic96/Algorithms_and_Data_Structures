# Algorithms and Data Structures
This is a library with some of the algorithms and data structures that I have encountered in my studies and work. 

Whenever I have time, I'll try to update the repository with new topics and implementations.

I hope to create some educational material and maybe even some videos eventually.

Feel free to take a look and please reach out if you have any questions! :)
